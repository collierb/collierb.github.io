I imagine there's been a resurgence of boardgame playing in the last year or so. I'm sure there's a data story in there somewhere - can you predict familial cohesion through boardgame sales? But I'm keen to focus my attention on just one - a boardgame called **Who Knows Where?** It's a game of geographical trivia and my brother is such a whiz at physical geography, the odds so heavily stacked in his favour, it's almost not worth playing. For example, you might get a clue like *What is the highest navigable lake in the world?*, and you might come up with the answer Lake Titicaca. You might then also know that the lake straddles the border between Peru and Bolivia - but given a map of the world split up into little square grids, would you be confident in which grid the lake belongs?

One common data visualisation technique in the vast and bewildering field of geospatial analysis is to forsake the need for a base map and forget fiddling around with what projection you might need and simply plot a load of data points given their longitude and latitude - the more the better.

I know the above stretch of coast like the back of my hand and I'm beginning to get to know the stretch of coast that is my current home. And I'm pretty confident that if someone plotted thousands of points in either coastal west Wales or coastal central Portugal, I'd have a decent chance of identifying the location. But I'm not so sure I could do so for other locations I don't know so well.

I am, though, reasonably confident that my brother could do so, given some clues. So I offer up the following test, not just for him but also for the two other people that occasionally read my blog. Can you identify the following coastal cities from the shape of the plotted point data alone?

*  Clue 1: As the data is sourced from [http://insideairbnb.com/](http://insideairbnb.com/) (a terrific resource asking some important questions) they are all popular holiday destinations
*  Clue 2: My brother has been to all four (which doesn't help those that don't know him intimately)
