Joe Biden (no-one needs reminding) is the oldest President of the United States ever, taking office at the age of 78. However, being a septuagenarian leader is not especially unusual in the world of politics. His opposite number in Japan, Yoshihide Suga, is 72. His just-vanquished presidential rival Donald Trump is 74. Trump, though, repeatedly tried to use *Sleepy Joe's* age against him during the presidential campaign, calling into question his mental faculties. But older leaders do tend to serve shorter terms, on average, as detailed in the chart below. This reflects the fact that many older politicians are used as stop gaps or interim appointments in inter-election years.

A more apt comparison with Biden may be Britain's re-election of Winston Churchill at the age of 77 in 1951 - the notion of an electorate seeking a safe and familiar pair of hands. However, Churchill effectively oversaw the administration of the opposition Labour party's manifesto and was in such ill health to be described by Roy Jenkins MP as 'gloriously unfit for office' and was forced to resign in 1955 as a result.

Biden appears full of vigour (whatever Trump might say) and has hit the ground running as shown by this [Economist chart on presidential orders passed](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/01/22/joe-biden-is-taking-executive-action-at-a-record-pace), out-performing his predecessors at an extraordinary rate and making renewed commitments on the world stage. He might consider, however, slowing down a bit if [this report on state leadership and mortality](https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h6424), published in the British Medical Journal in 2015, is anything to go by. The report concludes that state leadership takes years off your life and references a further study that suggests the role of vice-presidency is similarly taxing.

So although the chart below suggests that being a septuagenarian is no impediment to seeking office, at least in the more traditional patriarchies, Joe Biden is still 20 years older than the median age of G8 leaders at appointment to office over the last 50 years and indeed the 50 years before that. And given the evidence in the British Medical Journal report, the fact that Biden has served two terms as vice president, has the eyes and hopes of the world on him now and is already at the average life expectancy age of American males, perhaps the question should not be *is Joe Biden fit for office?* **but** *is office fit for Joe Biden?*
